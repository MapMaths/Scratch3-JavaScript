# Scratch3-JavaScript
My Scratch Projects will be show here as a JavaScript File.
If you want to see it as a Scratch Project, do this:
1. Package it as a ZIP File. (Some are ZIP File, so you don't need to do that)
2. Download it.
3. Rename the file as `*.sb3*`.
4. Open it by [Scratch Desktop 3.6](http://scratch.mit.edu/download) or by [Scratch Website](http://scratch.mit.edu)
